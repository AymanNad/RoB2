## Description

The **RoB 2 Assessment Tool** is a Streamlit application designed to facilitate the assessment of Risk of Bias (RoB) in randomized trials. Based on the RoB 2.0 guidelines, this tool allows researchers and analysts to systematically evaluate various domains of bias, including:

- Bias arising from the randomization process
- Bias due to deviations from intended interventions
- Bias due to missing outcome data
- Bias in the measurement of the outcome
- Bias in the selection of the reported result

The tool provides an interactive interface to help users quickly identify and understand the risk of bias in their studies. It also offers an overall risk of bias judgment based on the individual domain assessments. Designed with modularity in mind, the RoB 2 Assessment Tool can be easily extended to include additional features or similar tools in the future.
